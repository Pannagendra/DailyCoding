## 📈 Coding Philosophy

### **My Approach to Problem Solving:**

1. **🎯 Understand the Problem**
   - Read carefully and identify key constraints
   - Clarify edge cases and assumptions

2. **📝 Plan the Solution**
   - Break down the problem into smaller parts
   - Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms

3. **💻 Implement & Test**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Test with various inputs including edge cases

4. **🔄 Optimize & Refactor**
   - Analyze time and space complexity
   - Optimize for better performance when possible
