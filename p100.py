"""
Given a board of dimensions n Ã— m that needs to be cut into n*m squares. The cost of making a cut along a horizontal or vertical edge is provided in two arrays:

    x[]: Cutting costs along the vertical edges (length-wise).
    y[]: Cutting costs along the horizontal edges (width-wise).

Find the minimum total cost required to cut the board into squares optimally.
